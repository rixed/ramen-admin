/* Like a QComboBox, but that actually work with trees.
 * Notice that the displayed text is that of the model DisplayRole,
 * so there is no way to display the full path of an item (TODO).
 *
 * Also, given the QComboBox does not return the QModelIndex of the
 * selected item but only, at best, it's integer index, then the actual
 * item has to be retrieved from the model "by hand".
 *
 * Finally, to make it usable as a FunctionSelector, it must also be
 * possible to prevent the selection of any non-leaf item. */
