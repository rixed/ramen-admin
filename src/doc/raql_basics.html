<h1>Basic Syntax</h1>

<h3>Blanks</h3>

<p>Any space, tab, newline or comment is a separator.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>As in SQL, two dashes introduce a line comment. Everything from those dashes and the end of that line is treated as space.</p>

<p>There is no block comments.</p>

<h3>Quotation</h3>

<p>Some rare reserved keywords cannot be used as identifiers unless surrounded by simple quotes.  Quotes can also be used around operation names if they include characters that would be illegal in an identifier, such as spaces, dots or dashes.</p>
