<h1>Programs</h1>

<p>A program is a set of functions. The order of definitions does not matter.  The semi-colon is used as a separator (although omitting the final semi-colon is allowed).<p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre>
  DEFINE foo AS
    SELECT * FROM other_program/operation WHERE bar &gt; 0;

  DEFINE bar AS YIELD 1 EVERY 1 SECOND;

  DEFINE foobar AS
    SELECT glop, pas_glop FROM bazibar
    WHERE glop &gt;= 42;
</pre>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>TODO</p>
