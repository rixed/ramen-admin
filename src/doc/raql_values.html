<h1>Values</h1>

<h3>NULLs</h3>

<p>Like in SQL, some values might be NULL. Unlike SQL though, not <em>all</em> values can be NULL: indeed value types as well as nullability are inferred at compile time. This benefits performance, as many NULL checks can be done away with, and also reliability, as there is some guarantee that a NULL value will not pop up where it's least expected, such as in a WHERE clause for instance.</p>

<p>Users can check if a nullable value is indeed NULL using the <code>IS NULL</code> or <code>IS NOT NULL</code> operators, which turn a nullable value into a (non-nullable) boolean.</p>

<p>To write a literal <code>NULL</code> value enter <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>For any type <code>t</code>, the type <code>t?</code> denotes the type of possibly <code>NULL</code> values of type <code>t</code>.</p>

<h3>Booleans</h3>

<p>The type for booleans is called <code>boolean</code> (<code>bool</code> is also accepted). The only two boolean values are spelled <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>It is possible to (explicitly) convert integers and even floating point numbers from or to booleans. In that case, <code>0</code> is equivalent to <code>false</code> and other values to <code>true</code>.

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>The type for character strings is called <code>string</code>.  A literal string is double quoted (with <code>"</code>). To include a double-quote within a string, backslash it.  Other characters have a special meaning when backslashed: <code>"\n"</code> stands for linefeed, <code>"\r"</code> for a carriage return, <code>"\b"</code> for a backspace, <code>"\t"</code> stands for tab and <code>"\\"</code> stands for slash itself. If another character is preceded with a backslash then the pair is replaced with that character without the backslash.</p>

<p>Some functions consider strings as UTF-8 encoded, some consider strings as mere sequence of bytes.</p>

<h3>Numbers</h3>

<h4>Floats</h4>

<p>The type for real numbers is called <code>float</code>. It is the standard IEEE.754 64 bits float.</p>

<p>Literal values will cause minimum surprise: dot notation (<code>"3.14"</code>) and scientific notation (<code>"314e-2"</code>) are supported, as well as hexadecimal notation (<code>0x1.fp3</code>) and the special values <code>nan</code>, <code>inf</code> and <code>-inf</code>.</p>

<h4>Integers</h4>

<p>Ramen allows integer types of 9 different sizes from 8 to 128 bits, signed or unsigned: <code>i8</code>, <code>i16</code>, <code>i24</code>, <code>i32</code>, <code>i40</code>, <code>i48</code>, <code>i56</code>, <code>i64</code> and <code>i128</code>, which are signed integers, and <code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u24</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u40</code>, <code>u48</code>, <code>u56</code>, <code>u64</code> and <code>u128</code>, which are unsigned integers.</p>

<p>Ramen uses the conventional 2-complement encoding of integers with silent wrap-around in case of overflow.</p>

<p>When writing a literal integer it is possible to specify the intended type by suffixing it with the type name; for instance: <code>42u128</code> would be an unsigned integer 128 bits wide with value <code>42</code>. If no such suffix is present then Ramen will choose the narrowest possible type that can accommodate that integer value and that's not smaller than i32.  Thus, to get a literal integer smaller than i32 one has to suffix it. This is to avoid having non-intentionally narrow constant values that would wrap around unexpectedly.</p>

<p>In addition to the suffix, you can also use a cast, using the type name as a function: <code>u128(42)</code>. This is equivalent but more general as it can be used on other expressions than literal integers, such as floats, booleans or strings.</p>

<h4>Scales</h4>

<p>Any number can be followed by a <em>scale</em>, which is a short string indicating a multiplier.</p>

<p>The recognized scales are listed in the table below:</p>

<table>
  <caption>Numeric suffixes</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>names</th><th>multiplier</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>pico</code>, <code>p</code></td><td>0.000&nbsp;000&nbsp;001</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>micro</code>, <code>Âµ</code></td><td>0.000&mnsp;001</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>milli</code>, <code>m</code></td><td>0.001</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>Ki</code></td><td>1&nbsp;024</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>Mi</code></td><td>1&nbsp;048&nbsp;576</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>Ti</code></td><td>1&nbsp;099&nbsp;511&nbsp;627&nbsp;776</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Network addresses</h3>

<h4>Ethernet</h4>

<p>Ethernet addresses are accepted with the usual notation, such as: <code>18:d6:c7:28:71:f5</code> (without quotes; those are not strings).</p>

<p>Those values are internally stored as 48bits unsigned integers (big endian) and can therefore be cast from/to other integer types.</p>

<h4>Internet addresses</h4>

<p>IP addresses are also accepted, either v4 or v6, using the conventional notations, again without strings.</p>

<p>CIDR addresses are also accepted; for instance <code>192.168.10.0/24</code>. Notice that there is no ambiguity with integer division since arithmetic operators do not apply to IP addresses.</p>

<p>NOTE: the <code>in</code> operator can check whether an IP belongs to a CIDR.</p>

<h3>Compound types</h3>

<h4>Vectors</h4>

<p>Vectors of values of the same type can be formed with <code>[ expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ]</code>.</p>

<p>The type of vectors of <code>N</code> values of type <code>t</code> is noted <code>t[N]</code>.

<p>There is no way to ever build a vector of dimension 0. <code>[]</code> is not a valid value. This simplifies type inference a lot while not impeding the language too much, as the usefulness of a type that can contain only one value is dubious.</p>

<p>One can access the Nth item of a vector with the function <code>GET</code> or by suffixing the vector with the index in between brackets: if <code>v</code> is the vector <code>[1; 2; 3]</code>, then <code>GET(2, v)</code> as well as <code>v[2]</code> is <code>3</code> (indexes start at 0).</p>

<!-- TODO: document out of bound access -->

<h4>Arrays</h4>

<p>An arrays is like a vector which dimension is unknown until runtime.</p>

<p>It is not possible to create an immediate array (that would be a vector) but arrays are frequently returned by functions.</p>

<p>Accessing the Nth item of an array uses the same syntax as for vectors.</p>

<h4>Tuples</h4>

<p>Tuples are an ordered set of values of any type.</p>

<p>They are written within parentheses with values separated with semicolons, such as:<code>(1; "foo"; true)</code>.</p>

<p>One can extract the Nth item of a tuple with the special notation <code>1st</code>, <code>2nd</code>, <code>3rd</code>, <code>4th</code>, and so on. For instance, <code>2nd (1; "foo"; true)</code> is <code>"foo"</code>.

<h4>Records</h4>

<p>Records are like tuples, but with names given to each item.</p>

<p>Immediate values of record type uses curly braces instead of parentheses, and each item is preceded with its name followed by a colon. For instance: <code>{ age: 64; name: "John Doe" }</code>.</p>

<p>To access a given field of a record, suffix the record with a dot (<code>.</code>) and the field name: given the above record value as <code>person</code>, then <code>person.name</code> would be <code>"John Doe"</code>.</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

<p>In addition to a type, values can optionally have units.</p>

<p>When values with units are combined then the combination units will be automatically computed. In addition, Ramen will perform dimensional analysis to detect meaningless computations and will emit a warning (but not an error) in such cases.</p>

<p>The syntax to specify units is quite rough: in between curly braces, separated with a start (<code>*</code>) (or, equivalently, with a dot (<code>.</code>)), units are identified by name. Those names can be anything; They are mere identifier to Ramen. You can also use the power notation (<code>^N</code>) which avoids multiplying several times the same unit, and allows to use negative power as there is no dedicated syntax for dividing units.<p>

<p>Finally, each individual unit can be interpreted as <em>relative</em> if it's identifier ends with <code>(rel)</code>. Relative units are expressed as a difference with some point of reference, whereas absolute units are no such reference. For instance, a duration is expressed in seconds (absolute), whereas a date can be expressed in seconds <em>since some epoch</em> (relative to the epoch). Similarly, heat can be expressed in Kelvins (absolute) whereas a temperature can be expressed in Kelvins above freezing water temperature (relative).</p>

<p>Relative or absolute units follow different rules when combined.</p>
