/* Here we want to display two things:
 *
 * - A timeline of all archives, per worker.
 * - A combo to select any worker and if a time range is selected in the
 *   timeline then a button is enabled that ask for a explain analyze and then
 *   the replayers will be highlighted (the line and the used time ranges).
 *
 * This need to be a view connected to the graph model.
 * A TimeLineView, using the same filtering than the StorageTreeView.
 *
 * Technically, The first component is a custom FormLayout fed from the model,
 * when the label is the function name and the widget is the BinaryHeatLine,
 * connected to the GraphModel.
 * Lines are added in/removed from the FormLayout that is kept in name order.
 * Since the FormLayout will own the BinaryHeatLine widgets, the TimeLineGroup
 * will have to also be told that the pointers are gone.
 *
 * On top and at the bottom of the form are two TimeLines (in the FormLayout
 * with no label).
 *
 * At the very bottom a single line form can be found that ask ramen to
 * explain a query, ie tells what archives are needed to fulfill a given
 * replay query.
