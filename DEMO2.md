# 15mins sales oriented demo

Objective:
- Show with actual data, but with a 1sec frequency (use the simulator, that needs tweaking for that and esp for special data fields (non random timestamps would be especially nice!))
- Show the PVQL data is present
- Show we can have custom alerts for instance on PVQL DNS whenever a client uses another server than a given one
- Show we can have custom metrics, such as... port scanners for security, and alert on them
- Show we can customize basic alerts
- Show we can have various inputs (for instance, demo the example configuration with collectd - also, configure collectd for higher frequency!)

- Graphs (or animation?) to explain what a stream processor is vs a DB!
